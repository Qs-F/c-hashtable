# pkg c-hashtable

hash table implementation written in C

## Usage

see `test.c`

**WARNING**

_This is just the example. I don't expect the usage on production. Also, this is not the library package, this means don't use as header.

The file name is `ht.h`, but it doesn't use `extern`, `static` or something. Think it as just example.

In addition, as hash table, this doesn't have the way to delete key-value, it means no free. Since this is jsut example, I expect the light use.  
In that case, if the application finished, the data also will free.
